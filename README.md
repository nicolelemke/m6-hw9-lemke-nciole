MMC6278 Assignment 9


Sources I Used:

For styling:
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/css/css_text-transform.html


For JS:
https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/build-a-simple-weather-app-with-vanilla-javascript--cms-33893

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch



For API calls:

The tutorial helped me figure this one out. I am not comfortable with API calls thats for sure. I feel pretty uncomfrotable doing these things still especially with no pre made js file with instructions telling what to do and when.

I'd appreciate in class if maybe we did an assignment/tutorial of these together first before kind of just throwing us in it. In other classes even when using javascript we always first went through a similar activity together before doing one on our own.

I couldnt figure out how to do the last updated time or the link ot the image that was shown on the mockup.
